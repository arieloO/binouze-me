Binouze-me is a little app I built with the REST api [Punkapi.com](https://punkapi.com/) to show some skills !
Come try it out [here](https://arieloo.github.io/binouze-me/) : https://arieloo.github.io/binouze-me/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is almost entirely made from scratch.
I used the [qs lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) for querystring parsing
& [react-compound-slider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-compound-slider) library for the sliders & customized it for my color slider.
Used GoogleFonts, Icon8 and FontAwesome free icons.
